\title{Allele frequency matrix (loci × samples)}
\format{
A numeric matrix with 300 rows (loci) and 200 columns (samples).
Row names are locus IDs; column names are sample IDs.
}
\source{
Simulated for the \emph{Rcoding} package (teaching example).
}
\usage{
allele_freq_matrix
}
\description{
A synthetic dataset of allele frequency estimates across multiple loci and
samples. Values are simulated from per-locus base frequencies with added
sample-level noise, then perturbed by artefacts and structured missingness to
mimic realistic genetic data challenges.
}
\details{
Rows correspond to loci (\code{"locus_0001"}, \code{"locus_0002"}, …);
columns correspond to samples (\code{"sample_001"}, \code{"sample_002"}, …).

Features include:
\itemize{
  \item True allele frequencies in the range (0,1), with variation across loci and samples.
  \item Occasional negative values (< 0) introduced to represent artefacts from
        lab-based normalisation/calibration errors.
  \item Structured missingness: some loci fail across many samples, and some
        samples fail across many loci, in addition to random background NAs.
}

\examples{
dim(allele_freq_matrix)
allele_freq_matrix[1:5, 1:5]
sum(is.na(allele_freq_matrix))       # total missing values
sum(allele_freq_matrix < 0, na.rm=TRUE)  # count of artefacts
